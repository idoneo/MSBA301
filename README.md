Google's Ngram for the word Performance Management showing how there was a sharp increase in the use of the word around

I wish the Ngram viewer was more current at least to 2017.

Read a great article in [Harvard Magazine Online](https://harvardmagazine.com/2011/09/from-human-nature-to-human-resources)

From Human Nature to Human Resources which tied in nicely with Chapter 6 of Cokins book that is the text for this class. But I wonder how these 4 human drives will fare once AI become the center of the workforce and the proportion of human to robots shifts
